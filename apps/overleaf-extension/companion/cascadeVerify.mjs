// Downstream cascade verification, factored out of handleLeanPaneEditSave so
// every path that changes a recorded declaration (manual edit, chat-mirror run,
// re-formalize, repair run) can re-verify dependents through one pipeline.
// docs/FEATURE-overleaf-self-repair.md / docs/PLAN-overleaf-self-repair.md
// (Phase 0).
//
// The pipeline preserves three behaviors that postdate the original manual-edit
// spec and were bug-driven (see the inline comments, kept from the original):
//   1. the changed module is force-rebuilt before any dependent is checked, and
//      a rebuild failure fails CLOSED (dependents marked unknown, not valid);
//   2. each dependent's verdict comes from a real `lake build` (adapter
//      /rebuild), not the warm LSP check, which can pass against stale .oleans;
//   3. breakage propagates transitively down the recorded import graph to a
//      fixpoint, so second-hop dependents can't spuriously read "still valid".
//
// Whether a cascade is REQUIRED at all (cascadeRequired(classification) ||
// recovery-from-failure) is the caller's decision -- it depends on caller-local
// state such as the pre-change verdict. This module only executes the pass.
//
// Every collaborator is injected via `deps` rather than imported: the session/
// job helpers live in server.mjs (importing them here would be circular), and
// injection lets the test suite drive the pipeline with the same fake-fetchImpl
// pattern leanPaneEdit.test.mjs already uses.
