"""ContextVar-scoped tool registry (v2.3 item 27).

`REGISTRY`/`_ORDER` are the process-global base (built-ins, user tool_modules). Tools
registered *during* a run and scoped to it — today only MCP tools — go into a per-activation
overlay pushed by `run_events`, so two concurrent MCP-enabled runs can't corrupt each other's
toolsets. The old bug: one shared dict, so run A's `stop()` unregistered run B's tools by name.

These pin:
  * with no scope open, register/unregister/build_toolset behave exactly as before (global);
  * `scoped=True` inside a scope lands the tool in the overlay, visible to build_toolset,
    and gone the moment the scope is popped — no explicit unregister needed;
  * import-time registration (`scoped=False`) always hits the global, even inside a scope
    (so import-cached user tool_modules don't vanish after the first run);
  * a scoped tool can't shadow a global name (dup-check is against the effective registry);
  * THE FIX: two overlays on two threads are isolated — thread A popping its scope (or
    unregistering) never removes thread B's identically-named tool.

Run:  uv run python -m tests.registry.test_registry_scope
Exits 0 if every check passes, 1 otherwise.
