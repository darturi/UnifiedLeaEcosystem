"""Declarative tool registry — the single place a tool's schema and handler live.

Every tool is one `Tool` record (model-facing schema + a `dict[args] -> str`
handler). Built-in tools register themselves when `lea.tools` is imported;
custom tools register from user modules named in `agent.tool_modules`; MCP tools
(a later step) will register here too. The agent loop never imports tools
directly — it asks `build_toolset(selected)` for exactly the tools config wants.

Public API for custom tools:

    from lea.registry import tool

    @tool(name="sympy", description="...", input_schema={...})
    def sympy(args: dict) -> str:
        ...
