"""The one config object the agent loop reads — `LeaConfig`.

This is the *single* config dataclass for the whole system (LeaUI architecture
D1·cfg). The prover is a pure in-process library: `run_events(config, …)` is
typed to this class, and the **adapter** owns the loader (`adapter/app/config.py`
reads `config/lea.local.toml` and builds one of these) plus the config file.
There is no second adapter-side config and no mapper between them — one class,
one loader, one file.

The prover must never import the adapter (it stays independently importable), so
the dataclass lives here, in the lower layer. The agent-internal fields carry
sensible defaults so the UI can omit them; the two deployment fields at the
bottom (`lea_root`, `max_spend_usd`) are read by the adapter and ignored by the
loop. Provider API keys are deliberately **not** here — the adapter exports them
to `os.environ` (litellm reads them there), so this object holds no secrets and
is safe to log or serialize.
