"""Context compaction — the condenser (G1). Prune → summarize.

A long proving run's `messages` list is dominated by superseded tool output:
full `lean_check` error dumps, `read_file` bodies, `search_mathlib` hit lists —
each thousands of tokens, most made irrelevant by a later edit + recheck. Left
unchecked the coordinator's context grows without bound (the 15M-token run that
motivated this). The condenser keeps the model-facing window bounded WITHOUT
losing the thread, in two stages modelled on OpenHands'
`pipeline([observation_masking, llm_summarizing])`:

  1. PRUNE (deterministic, no LLM) — mask the *content* of superseded read-only
     tool results outside a recent window with a short placeholder. Cheap, keeps
     the message shape intact (the tool_result part and its id survive), and
     reclaims the bulk of the tokens. Runs whenever compaction triggers.

  2. SUMMARIZE (one LLM call) — only if pruning did not get back under the
     threshold: fold the older MIDDLE of the conversation into a single summary
     message, keeping the leading user context (the immutable goal) and the most
     recent turns verbatim. A CODE_STATE / TESTS / CHANGES summary (Lean-tuned)
     preserves what was tried and where the proof stands.

Message-shape safety is the load-bearing invariant. Every assistant tool_call
must keep its matching tool_result — LiteLLM turns each result into a
`role:"tool"` message keyed by id, and an orphan errors the provider. So the
summarizer only ever removes COMPLETE turns: the head is the leading all-user
context (it holds no tool calls), the tail always starts at an assistant
message, and the forgotten span between them is whole assistant+result pairs.
The condenser is copy-on-write — it never mutates the caller's message dicts.

This module is a lower layer than agent.py (agent imports it); it depends only
on `providers` (for the one summary stream) and `config`, never the loop.
