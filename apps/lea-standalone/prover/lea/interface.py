"""The prover's public surface — the one import the LeaUI adapter uses.

The prover exposes three capabilities (architecture D2):
  - run_events(...)  the agent loop                          (re-exported — A7)
  - check(path)      lean_check on a file, no model run      (A5, here)
  - verify(path)     SafeVerify on a file, no model run      (A6, here)
plus the typed event classes.

`check` / `verify` are standalone: give them a file path, they run the check and
hand back a structured verdict (a CheckResult / VerifyResult). No agent run — so the
adapter can verify a user-edited file on demand (the writeable canvas).

    never disagree with what a run would report for the same file.
