"""Project filesystem service — view / read / edit / export the project repo (D34).

A project *is* a git repo on disk (D21/D22), so the Filesystem tab is mostly
*exposure*, not new storage: a tree of the repo's source + assets (hiding git and
Lake build internals), a text read of any file, an edit that funnels through the
same commit-on-write primitive as the v2 canvas (path-escape guarded, D3), and a
zip export of the whole thing. No new content store — git already owns the bytes.

The proofs root is passed in by callers (like the other project services) so this
stays testable against a scratch dir; it never imports config itself.
