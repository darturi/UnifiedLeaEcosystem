"""Run admission registry (v2.3 concurrency, item 9).

The single source of truth for "may this run start, and is there room?" It replaces
the old split decision — the endpoint peeking a scalar (``bridge.current_active_run_id``)
while the *claim* happened later, inside the spawned thread (``active_run_lock.acquire``).
That gap was a **TOCTOU**: two attaches for two different runs both peeked and saw
``None``, both spawned a thread, and one lost the lock and had to emit ``done(failed)``.

Here the check *is* the claim: one lock guards two maps and one decision function,
``try_admit()``, called at the endpoint **before** the thread is spawned. A caller
that is admitted holds a slot until it calls ``release()``.

Capacity is ``LEA_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`` (**default 1**). At 1 this behaves exactly
like the single-slot lock it replaces — externally a no-op — so concurrency lands
dark and is turned on by raising the knob.

Two maps, not one:

  * ``_active: dict[run_id -> ActiveRun]`` — who is running (capacity is ``len``).
  * ``_by_session: dict[session_id -> run_id]`` — which run owns each chat, so a
    second turn for a *busy session* is distinguishable from a *new* session at
    capacity. The two get different answers (``session_busy`` vs ``at_capacity``):
    a session's own follow-up is a supersede candidate (item 10), a stranger at a
    full house is a plain 409.

Ordering of the checks matters and is deliberate:

  1. ``already_active`` — this exact ``run_id`` is already admitted. A second
     events connection for the *same* run (the passive-viewer case) must not be
     treated as contention.
  2. ``session_busy`` — a *different* run for this session holds a slot. Checked
     **before** capacity on purpose: at capacity 1 a same-session follow-up would
     otherwise get ``at_capacity`` and could never supersede its own incumbent.
  3. ``at_capacity`` — the house is full and none of it is yours.
  4. ``admitted`` — a slot is claimed and recorded.

``release()`` is idempotent: releasing an unknown/already-released run is a no-op,
so the run thread's ``finally`` can call it unconditionally without a second fault.
