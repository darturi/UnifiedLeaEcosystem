"""A rejoinable, multi-subscriber event stream for one run (v2.3).

Why this exists
---------------
Before this, a run's live events flowed through a single in-memory ``Queue`` owned
by the *first* ``/api/runs/{id}/events`` connection — the one that got admitted and
spawned the driver thread. Any *second* connection to the same running run (a
reconnect after a dropped stream, or switching away from a running chat and back)
got a "passive view" that emitted nothing but a terminal ``done``. So a reattached
UI went silent until the run finished — approvals, code steps, and messages only
appeared after a full session-switch re-fetch. That is the "my click only registers
after I switch sessions" bug.

The broker fixes it structurally. The driver publishes events *to the broker*, not
to one connection's queue. The broker keeps the run's events in memory with a
monotonic ``seq``; any number of connections subscribe at any time, replay
everything after their cursor, then follow live events. The driver's lifecycle is
decoupled from any single connection: a reconnect rejoins the *live* stream instead
of a dead passive view.

Design notes
------------
* **Buffer for the run's (bounded) lifetime.** Runs are minutes long; holding their
  events in memory is cheap for this local/single-tenant adapter. The broker is
  dropped when the run ends (``bridge.run_lea``'s ``finally``); a late connection to
  an already-finished run is caught by the endpoint's terminal-status 409 before it
  ever looks for a broker.
* **``put`` is Queue-compatible** (takes ``{"type", "payload"}``) so the runner's
  existing ``emit()`` writes to it unchanged.
* **Cursor replay.** ``events_after(cursor)`` returns everything with ``seq >
  cursor``. A fresh subscriber passes ``cursor=0`` and replays the whole buffer; the
  browser's native reconnect passes ``Last-Event-ID`` so it resumes without
  re-replaying. Client event handlers already dedupe by id (messages, code steps,
  approvals) and rebuild the in-progress assistant bubble from replayed deltas, so a
  full replay is idempotent.
* **Thread-safe.** The driver thread calls ``put`` while the asyncio endpoint thread
  calls ``events_after``; both take ``_lock``.
