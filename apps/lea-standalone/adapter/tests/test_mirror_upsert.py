"""Tex-mirror sync modes (PLAN-system-hardening 3.2).

`reconcile` (default) treats the payload as the full truth set — absent files
are pruned and their index rows dropped. `upsert` is the active-buffer tier:
it writes only the provided files and must never delete anything, because the
extension sends just the buffer being edited.
