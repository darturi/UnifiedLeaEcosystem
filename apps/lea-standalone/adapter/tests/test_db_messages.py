"""C2 tests: the edit-note link (D11), now that messages live on `timeline`.

A user's canvas-edit explanation is a *normal* transcript row — no bespoke channel
— distinguished only by `kind='edit_note'`. This file used to also pin a
`commit_sha` column linking the note to the edit's git commit, plus a CHECK that an
edit_note must carry one.

**Both are gone, and the link is weaker now — deliberately.** The note's tie to the
edit it explains is positional: the note is written immediately after the step, and
`edit_notes_since(session_id, seq)` reads it back by position. That was already the
real mechanism — the reader has always been positional, and the sha was never
consulted to find a note. The CHECK was enforcing that a *decorative* field was
non-null. What it genuinely bought was "an edit_note is never orphaned", and
`test_an_edit_note_lands_after_the_step_it_explains` is what now covers that.

`kind` and `author` also stop being the same concept spelled twice: `kind` is what a
row is, `author` is who made it (the split OpenHands' `SourceType` draws and opencode
conflates). The old `kind` column defaulted to 'assistant' — a *role* value used as a
kind default — so it lied for every row nobody set explicitly.
