"""Run admission registry (item 9) — the check-that-is-the-claim.

The bug this closes is a TOCTOU: on `main` the endpoint peeked one scalar and the
claim happened later inside the run thread, so two attaches could both peek `None`
and both spawn. The registry's fix is *structural* — it fuses check and claim into
one `try_admit` call, so there is no gap between them regardless of locking.

A note on the lock, measured rather than assumed: `try_admit`'s critical section is
pure dict ops, and under CPython's GIL that runs to completion without a thread
switch — so `test_try_admit_semantics_under_overlap` pins the capacity *accounting*
under overlap but would pass with or without the lock (the GIL already serializes
it). The lock is not decorative, though: the moment the section can yield the GIL —
any I/O added later, or free-threaded (PEP 703) Python — an unlocked check-then-set
over-admits wildly. `test_lock_serializes_a_yielding_critical_section` is the one
with teeth: it injects a yield mid-section and shows the real Lock holds at capacity
while a no-op lock admits everyone.

Semantics pinned here (order matters — see the module docstring):
  already_active (same run) < session_busy (same session, other run) < at_capacity.
Plus: release frees a slot, is idempotent, and clears the session map only if it
still points at the releasing run (so a superseding run, item 10, isn't clobbered).
