# Lea prover in-process (architecture D1 — no separate Lea API process).
#
# No API key is needed to start. The container boots keyless; the user adds and
# validates their key in the app's Settings pane, which saves it to
# /app/config/lea.local.toml (mounted as a volume so it persists). The adapter
# loads that key from config and exports it to its own environment per run.
