# Feature: Inline Lea Tags (LaTeX-Package-Based Target Markers)

## Summary

Add a second, opt-in way to mark a theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, or
definition for Lea: an invisible LaTeX command from a small first-party
package, instead of (or alongside) the existing `% lea:` comment marker.

```tex
\usepackage{lea-tags}
...
\begin{claim}\label{clm:even-square}
\leatheorem{label=even_square, uses={even_def}, context={Use the parity definition first.}}
If $n$ is even, then $n^2$ is even.
\end{claim}
```

`\leatheorem{...}` typesets nothing. The Overleaf extension scans the editor
source for these commands the same way it scans for `% lea:` comments today,
and produces the same target shape the rest of the pipeline already consumes.

This is additive, not a replacement. The current comment-marker system
(`docs/FEATURE-overleaf-comment-marked-theorems.md`,
`docs/FEATURE-overleaf-definition-tags.md`) is implemented and working
(`apps/overleaf-extension/extension/targetParserCore.mjs`); nothing here
changes its behavior.

## Goal

Let Lea recognize a theorem-like or definition-like block without requiring
the block to sit inside one of a fixed set of LaTeX environment names.

The current detector only looks inside `theorem`, `lemma`, `proposition`,
`corollary`, and `definition` environments
(`SUPPORTED_ENVIRONMENTS` in `targetParserCore.mjs`). Real papers routinely
define their own theorem-like environments with `\newtheorem` — `claim`,
`conjecture`, `fact`, `observation`, journal-specific names, or renamed
environments from a shared house style file. None of those work with Lea
today even though the comment-marker mechanics underneath are environment-name
agnostic in every other respect.

A package-based tag also gives LaTeX itself a chance to catch malformed
metadata (unbalanced braces, a stray `}` in `context={...}`) as a normal
compile error, instead of the author finding out only from the extension's
own diagnostics panel.

## Current Behavior

Today's detector works in two layers, both inside `targetParserCore.mjs`:

1. `findSupportedEnvironments` regex-scans for `\begin{theorem}`,
   `\begin{lemma}`, `\begin{proposition}`, `\begin{corollary}`, and
   `\begin{definition}` and tracks nesting with a stack.
2. `findLeaCommentGroups` regex-scans for contiguous `% lea: ...` comment
   lines, then `parseCommentMarkedTargets` associates each group with its
   smallest enclosing environment from step 1, requires exactly one marker
   group per environment, validates `label`/`uses` as Lean identifiers, and
   strips the marker comments and `\label{...}` from the extracted body text
   (`stripLeaTargetText`).

Each resulting target already carries a `syntax` field, currently always
`"comment"` — a sign the original design anticipated more than one marker
syntax even though only one is implemented.

The legacy `\theorem[label=...]{...}` command syntax also still works as a
deprecated compatibility path (see `README.md`).

## Why A LaTeX Package Instead Of Just More Comment Syntax

Three things a comment marker structurally cannot do, that a real command
can:

- **Environment-name independence.** A command can say what kind of target it
  is (`\leatheorem`, `\lealemma`, `\leadefinition`, or a generic
  `\lea{kind=theorem,...}`) without the enclosing environment's name having
  to match an allowlist. This removes the single biggest practical limitation
  of the current system.
- **Compile-time structural validation.** A malformed `% lea: context={...`
  with a missing closing brace is silently mis-parsed by the extension and
  the author may not notice until the target looks wrong in the popover. A
  malformed `\leatheorem{context={...}` is a LaTeX compile error the moment
  the author saves, surfaced in Overleaf's own log.
- **A documented, versioned surface.** A `.sty` file can ship its own usage
  comments and a changelog, and tools that understand LaTeX packages (editor
  autocomplete, linters) can reason about it. A bare comment convention has
  none of that.

What it gives up, relative to a comment:

- **A new failure mode.** A forgotten `\usepackage{lea-tags}` turns every
  `\leatheorem{...}` call into an "Undefined control sequence" compile error
  for the whole document. A forgotten or malformed `% lea:` comment just means
  the target is silently not detected — annoying, never build-breaking.
- **A new distribution problem.** The package file has to exist somewhere the
  Overleaf project's compiler can find it. See Distribution below.
- **Slightly more authoring ceremony** for documents that don't already use
  amsthm-style environments at all.

## Recommendation

Ship tag-based detection as a second `syntax` value alongside the existing
comment marker, not a replacement:

- Keep `% lea:` comments as the zero-setup default. It requires no preamble
  change and can never break a build, so it stays the right answer for
  someone trying Lea for the first time.
- Add `\lea{...}` / `\leatheorem{...}` / `\lealemma{...}` /
  `\leaproposition{...}` / `\leacorollary{...}` / `\leadefinition{...}` as the
  answer for documents whose theorem-like environments aren't in the
  allowlist, or for authors who'd rather have a compile error than a silently
  unrecognized marker.
- Reuse the existing key=value / braced-list parsing helpers
  (`parseBalancedSuffix`, `splitMetadataEntries`, `splitTopLevel`, `unbrace`,
  `parseMetadata`) for tag arguments. They already operate on a plain string
  and don't care whether that string came from a comment or a macro argument,
  so the new parser surface is mostly a new "find the markers" function, not
  new metadata parsing.

## Tag Syntax

### Package

A single file, `lea-tags.sty`, defining commands that take a required
metadata argument and an *optional* second (body) argument:

```tex
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{lea-tags}[2026/07/01 v0.2 Lea inline formalization tags]
\RequirePackage{xparse}

% Generic form: caller states kind= explicitly.
\NewDocumentCommand{\lea}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}

% Named convenience wrappers, equivalent to \lea{kind=...,<args>}.
\NewDocumentCommand{\leatheorem}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\lealemma}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\leaproposition}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\leacorollary}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}
\NewDocumentCommand{\leadefinition}{m g}{\IfValueT{#2}{#2}}
```

`m` is the required metadata argument; LaTeX still parses it as a balanced
group, which is what gives us compile-time brace validation, but its
contents are never typeset (only ever passed to `parseMetadata`). `g` is
xparse's "optional group" type: present only if a `{` immediately follows
(after skipping whitespace); if present, it's typeset verbatim via
`\IfValueT{#2}{#2}` and is also the statement text sent to Lea. If absent,
the command is the original no-op form from v0.1 -- see "Tagging an existing
environment" above.

Verified by compiling a test document with `pdflatex`: both forms render
correctly, and a tag with no body argument followed (only whitespace, no
other content) by a later, unrelated `{...}` group does get absorbed as that
tag's body -- exactly matching plain TeX argument-scanning semantics. See
"Standalone form" below for what this means for authors.

### Tagging an existing (possibly custom) environment

```tex
\begin{claim}\label{clm:foo}
\leatheorem{label=foo_claim, uses={bar}, context={Treat foo as a Nat predicate.}}
Statement text...
\end{claim}
```

`claim` is not in today's environment allowlist and would be invisible to
Lea under the comment-marker path. Because `\leatheorem` states its own kind,
the parser no longer needs `claim` to be a recognized name — it only needs
*some* enclosing `\begin{X}...\end{X}` to know where the target's body
starts and ends.

### Generic form, for any kind

```tex
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:open}
\lea{kind=theorem, label=open_conjecture, context={State only; mark as a stub if unprovable today.}}
Goldbach-style statement...
\end{conjecture}
```

`kind` accepts the same values the comment marker already accepts:
`theorem` and `definition`.

### Standalone form: no enclosing environment at all

A tag with a second (body) argument needs nothing to enclose it -- the
body's own braces give the parser an unambiguous boundary, the same role
`\begin{X}...\end{X}` plays for the other two forms:

```tex
\leatheorem{label=pythagorean, uses={right_triangle}}
{In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the
squares of the other two sides.}
```

This addresses the original motivating question directly: an enclosing
block was only ever needed because a single-argument tag carries no body
text of its own. With a body argument, there's nothing left to enclose.

The metadata and body arguments don't need to be on the same line (TeX's
own argument scanning skips whitespace, including newlines, between
arguments, and the parser mirrors that exactly rather than approximating
it) -- but anything other than whitespace between them (prose, a comment,
another command) means there's no body argument, and the tag falls back to
needing an enclosing environment, with a clearer `missing_environment`
message pointing at this option.

**Caveat, verified against real `pdflatex` output, not just reasoned about:**
because TeX's argument scanning (and this parser, deliberately matching it)
skips arbitrary whitespace looking for the next `{`, a single-argument tag
immediately followed by an unrelated standalone `{...}` group -- with
nothing but blank lines between them -- *will* be absorbed as that tag's
body, both in real Overleaf compilation and in this parser's detection.
Avoid leaving a tag with no intended body directly before an unrelated
braced group with nothing in between.

A malformed standalone tag (e.g. an invalid `label=`) is correctly rejected
by `targetParserCore.mjs` like any other diagnostic, but does **not**
currently surface in the Lean pane inventory the way a malformed
environment-based marker does (which still shows up, just marked
not-formalizable) -- see `docs/PLAN-overleaf-inline-lea-tags.md` for why,
and treat this as a known gap rather than a Lean-pane bug if you hit it.

### Code-block form: a statement typeset as a Lean listing

`leacode` is a code-block variant of the tags above. Its body is typeset
verbatim as a Lean code listing (via the `listings` package) instead of as
prose, and that same code is sent to Lea verbatim as the target's statement
text — it flows through the pipeline **exactly** like every other target, the
only difference being how it renders in the PDF:

```tex
\begin{leacode}{label=add_zero, uses={my_lemma}, context={Use simp.}}
theorem add_zero (n : Nat) : n + 0 = n := by simp
\end{leacode}
```

Because `listings` reads the body verbatim, Lean's own catcode-hostile
characters (`_`, `\`, `{`, `}`, `->`, …) survive untouched — which is why this
is an environment rather than a braced macro argument. The single required
argument is the usual metadata argument (`label`/`uses`/`context`/`kind`), read
but never typeset. `kind=` is honored exactly as the generic `\lea{...}` command
honors it (default: `theorem`).

Detection specifics (`targetParserCore.mjs`):

- `leacode` is registered as a verbatim-like environment, so its interior is
  masked out of the comment/tag/environment scanners (a `\begin{theorem}` or
  `% lea:` sitting *inside* the listed code is never a false marker). A
  dedicated scanner, `findLeaCodeEnvironments`, then reads the **raw** source to
  recover the block, skipping any `leacode` that appears inside *another*
  verbatim-like block (a documentation example).
- It produces the same synthetic-environment target shape a standalone tag does,
  with `syntax: "leacode"` and `latexEnvironment: "leacode"`. Downstream
  (companion prompt, adapter, staleness hashing, Lean pane) is unchanged — a
  `leacode` theorem is indistinguishable from a `\leatheorem` one.
- A missing `\usepackage{lea-tags}` (or inline `\lstnewenvironment{leacode}`)
  triggers the same `tag_package_not_loaded` diagnostic the tag commands do.

Note: because the body is passed through as-is, an author writing genuine Lean
here is handing Lea already-formal code under the normal "formalize this
statement" prompt. In practice Lea uses the Lean it is given; a future prompt
variant could acknowledge the code is already Lean, but that is deliberately
**not** part of this form — keeping the path identical to every other target is
the whole point.

### Shorthand environment (not yet implemented)

For authors who don't already use `amsthm`, a sugar environment could wrap
both the visual numbering and the tag in one block:

```tex
\begin{leatheorem}{label=foo}
Statement text...
\end{leatheorem}
```

This would be an ordinary `\newtheorem`-backed environment plus a
`\leatheorem{...}` tag at the top, detected exactly like the
tag-on-existing-environment case (pure sugar, not a new detection path). The
shipped v1 package only defines the six no-op tag commands
(`\lea`/`\leatheorem`/`\lealemma`/`\leaproposition`/`\leacorollary`/
`\leadefinition`); this shorthand environment is deferred to a later version
-- see Future Extensions.

## Metadata Fields

Identical semantics to the existing comment marker — `label` (required, valid
Lean identifier), `uses` (optional braced comma list of prior Lea labels),
`context` (optional free text), `kind` (only meaningful with the generic
`\lea{...}` form; implied by the named wrappers). See
`docs/FEATURE-overleaf-comment-marked-theorems.md` and
`docs/FEATURE-overleaf-definition-tags.md` for the field-level rules this
reuses verbatim.

## Detection And Extraction Changes (`targetParserCore.mjs`)

1. New `findLeaTagCommands(source)`, parallel to `findLeaCommentGroups`:
   regex-scan for `\lea`, `\leatheorem`, `\lealemma`, `\leaproposition`,
   `\leacorollary`, `\leadefinition` (word-boundary, not preceded by a
   letter, so it doesn't match a user's own `\leaniteration`-style macro),
   then extract the single `{...}` argument with the existing
   `parseBalancedSuffix` helper. Reject (with a diagnostic) a tag command
   whose argument isn't a single balanced brace group immediately following
   it.
2. The named wrappers map directly to a `kind` (`\leatheorem` /
   `\lealemma` / `\leaproposition` / `\leacorollary` → `theorem`,
   `\leadefinition` → `definition`); the generic `\lea{...}` reads `kind=`
   from its own argument, same as `% lea: formalize kind=definition` does
   today.
3. New `findGenericEnvironments(source)`: the same nesting-stack approach as
   `findSupportedEnvironments`, but matching **any** `\begin{X}...\end{X}`
   pair rather than only the allowlisted names. Used only to locate the
   smallest enclosing environment for a *tag*-based marker that has no body
   argument of its own. The comment-marker path keeps using the allowlisted
   `findSupportedEnvironments` unchanged, so no existing document's behavior
   changes.
4. After the metadata argument, check (skipping whitespace, including
   newlines) for a second `{...}` argument, matched with a *newline-tolerant*
   balanced-brace scan (the metadata argument's own matcher stays
   single-line, matching every other same-line convention in this parser).
   If present, this is the standalone form: a synthetic environment-shaped
   object is built directly from the body argument's span (`name` = the tag
   command name, `bodyFrom`/`bodyTo` = inside the body's braces) and fed into
   the same per-group pipeline everything else uses, skipping the
   environment-lookup step entirely. If absent, behavior is unchanged from
   v0.1 (needs an enclosing environment).
5. Tag markers with neither a body argument nor an enclosing environment
   produce a `missing_environment` diagnostic, same code the comment path
   already uses for the analogous case, reworded to mention the standalone
   form as an alternative.
6. `extractEnvironmentText` / `stripLeaTargetText` are reused unchanged for
   body extraction in all three forms (environment-enclosed, generic, and
   standalone) — the synthetic environment object has the same shape real
   ones do, so no extraction code needed to know which form produced it.
   `stripLeaTargetText` strips `\lea{...}` / `\leatheorem{...}` / etc. calls
   (matched with the same balanced-brace logic) from the extracted body, the
   same way it already strips `% lea: ...` lines and `\label{...}`.
7. Targets produced this way set `syntax: "tag"` instead of `"comment"`. The
   field already exists in the target shape and is plumbed through; nothing
   downstream needs to change to carry it.
8. A marker count or kind mismatch between a comment marker and a tag command
   inside the same environment reuses the existing `duplicate_marker` /
   `environment_mismatch` diagnostics, generalized to be syntax-agnostic —
   one target per environment, regardless of which syntax declared it. A
   standalone tag is keyed by its own position, so it can never collide with
   another marker (nothing else can share its span).

### New diagnostic: package not loaded

Tag commands only compile if `lea-tags.sty` (or an inline fallback
definition, see Distribution) is loaded. Add a preamble check: scan the text
before `\begin{document}` for `\usepackage{lea-tags}` (or `\input{lea-tags}`,
or a `\NewDocumentCommand{\lea}` redefinition) whenever the body contains a
tag command. If it's missing, emit a `tag_package_not_loaded` diagnostic
*before* the author hits a broken Overleaf compile, since that failure mode
doesn't exist for comment markers and is the main new risk this feature
introduces.

## Companion Behavior

No prompt changes. The companion already branches on `targetKind`
(`theorem` vs `definition`), and `syntax` is informational only — record it
on the job for debugging/telemetry, but it must not affect which prompt is
selected or how `uses` is resolved. A theorem tagged via `\leatheorem{...}`
and one tagged via `% lea: formalize` are indistinguishable to the companion
and the adapter.

## UI Behavior

No new user-facing copy for the common case — badges, popovers, and status
text stay exactly as they are for comment-marked targets. The only new UI
surface is the `tag_package_not_loaded` diagnostic, which should be shown
prominently (it is the one failure mode in this feature that can break the
author's document compile, not just hide a target from Lea).

A `(tag)` vs `(comment)` distinction is useful only in a diagnostics/debug
view, not in the primary popover.

## Distribution

This is the open question with the most product-decision weight, called out
explicitly rather than decided here:

1. **Manual install (recommended for v1).** The user downloads
   `lea-tags.sty` from the extension's options page or repo, uploads it as a
   project file in Overleaf, and adds one `\usepackage{lea-tags}` line. No
   new extension permissions, no new write surface. Matches how most users
   already install a house-style `.sty` on Overleaf.
2. **Inline preamble snippet (recommended alongside #1).** Since the package
   body is five `\NewDocumentCommand` lines with no real dependencies beyond
   `xparse`, also publish it as a copy-paste preamble block so users who
   don't want a second project file can paste it directly instead of
   `\usepackage{lea-tags}`. Zero file-upload step at all.
3. **Auto-provisioning (future).** A one-click "Insert Lea tags" action that
   writes the `.sty` file into the Overleaf project and patches the main
   `.tex` preamble automatically. This needs Overleaf project-file write
   access the extension doesn't currently have (it reads editor text and
   overlays DOM badges; it doesn't write project files). Worth revisiting if
   the extension gains project-file write capability for other reasons, but
   out of scope for the first version of this feature.

## Compatibility

- Existing `% lea:` comment markers, the legacy `\theorem[label=...]{...}`
  command, and the existing environment allowlist all continue to work
  unchanged.
- A document that never loads `lea-tags` and never uses tag commands behaves
  exactly as it does today — this feature has no effect until an author
  opts in.
- A theorem-like environment may use either syntax but not both; using both
  in the same environment is a `duplicate_marker` diagnostic, same as two
  comment-marker groups today.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A custom (non-allowlisted) environment such as `\begin{claim}...\end{claim}`
   containing `\leatheorem{label=foo}` appears in the extension UI as a
   formalizable theorem target.
2. The tag commands are invisible in the rendered PDF.
3. The extracted target text excludes tag commands and `\label{...}`, exactly
   as it already excludes `% lea:` comments and `\label{...}`.
4. `label`, `uses`, `context`, and `kind` preserve identical semantics and
   validation to the comment-marker path.
5. A document with a tag command but no `\usepackage{lea-tags}` (and no
   inline fallback definition) produces a `tag_package_not_loaded`
   diagnostic in the extension before the author needs to discover it from a
   failed Overleaf compile.
6. Mixing a comment marker and a tag command in the same environment produces
   a clear duplicate-marker diagnostic.
7. Targets produced via tags carry `syntax: "tag"`; targets produced via
   comments continue to carry `syntax: "comment"`.
8. The companion and adapter behave identically regardless of which `syntax`
   produced a given `targetKind`/`targetLabel`/`targetText`.
9. All existing comment-marker and legacy-command tests continue to pass
   unmodified.
10. New tests cover: custom-environment detection, the generic `\lea{kind=...}`
    form, each named wrapper, the missing-package diagnostic, and
    cross-syntax duplicate detection.
11. A tag with a body argument (the standalone form) needs no enclosing
    environment and produces a target whose `latexEnvironment` is the tag
    command name.
12. The standalone form's body argument may span multiple lines/paragraphs;
    the metadata argument stays single-line.
13. A standalone tag's body, once stripped, excludes any nested
    `\label{...}` the same way environment-enclosed targets do.

## Future Extensions

- The `leatheorem` shorthand environment described above, for documents with
  no existing theorem-like environments.
- A "draft mode" rendering of tags as small margin notes (visible only when a
  document-level flag is set), for authors who want a visual reminder of
  what's tagged without publishing it.
- Tagging sub-claims inside a `proof` environment, once there's a use case
  for formalizing intermediate steps rather than only top-level statements.
- Auto-provisioning the package into a project (Distribution option 3 above).
- A lint mode the companion or a CI step can run against a `.tex` source to
  report tag/comment diagnostics without opening Overleaf at all.

## Implementation Status

Implemented (2026-06-30): all phases in `docs/PLAN-overleaf-inline-lea-tags.md`
are done and tested -- `lea-tags.sty` (options-page download + copy-snippet),
tag detection and the `tag_package_not_loaded`/`malformed_tag`/
`suspicious_environment` diagnostics in `targetParserCore.mjs`, Lean pane
tag-awareness in `leanPaneManifest.mjs`, and `targetSyntax` telemetry on the
companion job record. See that plan's Status section for the two correctness
issues found during implementation (and fixed) that aren't otherwise obvious
from this spec.

The standalone (body-argument) form documented above -- removing the
enclosing-environment requirement entirely -- was added in a follow-up pass
the same day, once it was clear from the original Q&A that "must be inside a
block" was a real limitation worth removing, not just an inherent property
of the tag approach. See the PLAN doc's Status section for that pass's notes.
