# Feature: Batch Stub / Formalize — "Stub all" and "Formalize all"

## Summary

The Lean pane offers two project-level launchers above the item tree:

- **Stub all (N)** — generate a Lean `sorry`-stub for every un-stubbed theorem
  in the project.
- **Formalize all (N)** — run Lea to formalize every item that has no verified
  proof yet (unformalized theorems *and* definitions, existing `sorry`-stubs to
  complete, and broken/stale items to re-formalize), skipping only already-valid
  work.

These are the **batch versions** of the existing per-item `POST /stub` and
`POST /formalize` actions. They reuse the sequential, spend-cap-aware,
dependency-ordered dispatch pioneered by **batch repair**
(`docs/FEATURE-overleaf-self-repair.md`) — the same in-memory batch record,
progress panel, `repair-batch-updated` event, and `/lean-pane/repair/all/continue`
resume endpoint — distinguished by a new `operation` field
(`repair | stub | formalize`).

## Why reuse the repair batch

A naive client-side loop firing N `/formalize` calls at once would bypass the
three properties that make the repair batch safe:

1. **Spend-cap pause/resume.** A cap reached mid-batch pauses on the current
   item (resumable via *Continue remaining* once the limit is raised) instead of
   failing it or blowing past the cap.
2. **Dependency ordering.** Formalizing `B` before the lemma `A` it `uses` would
   deny `B`'s run the recorded context of `A`. The batch topologically orders
   items by their `targetUses` so dependencies run first (the repair batch does
   the same over the project *import* graph; here we order over the batch-local
   uses graph, reusing `topologicalRepairOrder` with labels standing in for
   modules).
3. **One run at a time.** Sequential dispatch keeps N concurrent Lea jobs from
   hammering the adapter.

## Server (`apps/overleaf-extension/companion/server.mjs`)

- `POST /stub/all` → `handleStubAll`, `POST /formalize/all` → `handleFormalizeAll`.
  Both take `{ overleafProjectId, items: [<full target payload>] }` — the *full*
  per-target payload (`targetText`, `targetUses`, `sourceHash`, …), unlike repair,
  which addresses already-recorded artifacts by label.
- `startTargetBatch(payload, state, operation)` validates each item
  (`validateTargetPayload`; stub additionally rejects `definition` targets — a
  definition has no stub path), runs the standard preflight trio
  (`syncSharedSettingsFromAdapter` → `validateLeaRuntime` → `spendLimitReached`),
  orders by uses (`orderTargetsByUses`), and kicks off `runTargetBatch`.
- `runTargetBatch` dispatches each item through the existing single-item handler:
  - **stub** → `handleStub` (already blocks to completion). A failure is
    independent — the loop marks it failed and continues.
  - **formalize** → `handleFormalize` (returns as soon as the run starts;
    `awaitJobSettled` polls the job to its terminal `finishedAt`). A failure
    carries dependency semantics: items that transitively *use* the failed one
    are skipped, then the batch pauses for the user's continue/stop decision on
    the independent remainder — exactly the repair batch's behavior.
- The batch record, `repairBatchSnapshot` (now carrying `operation`), pruning,
  and the continue endpoint are shared. `resumeBatch` routes a continued batch to
  `runRepairBatch` or `runTargetBatch` by `operation`.

## Client (`apps/overleaf-extension/extension/`)

- `content.js`: `renderLeanPaneBatchActions` renders the two buttons above the
  tree, each present only when it has eligible work and hidden while a batch panel
  is already showing (one batch surface at a time). `stubAllTheorems` /
  `formalizeAllItems` gather the eligible items, flush the `.tex` mirror, POST the
  full target set, and drive the **same** batch panel + polling the repair batch
  uses. The panel wording is generalized by `operation`.
- `leanPaneView.mjs`: `stubbableItems` / `formalizableItems` select exactly the
  items whose own per-item buttons would offer the action, delegating to the
  existing `canStubPaneItem` / `canFormalizePaneItem` predicates (which honor
  `formalizable` and skip in-progress runs and already-valid work).
  `formatRepairOutcome` gained the `stubbed` / `formalized` / `disproved` states
  and operation-aware verbs.

## Stopping a batch mid-flight

A running batch is interruptible. While it is actively working the progress
panel shows a **Stop** button; clicking it `POST`s to
`/lean-pane/repair/all/cancel` (`handleBatchCancel`, shared by all operations,
including repair), which:

1. sets a `cancelRequested` flag both runners poll between items (they `break`
   at the next iteration boundary), and
2. **interrupts the item currently mid-run** via `interruptApiRun` — every run
   type records `job.apiRunId` at run start through the shared
   `runLeaProofJobForJob` driver, so the running entry's job carries the id the
   adapter needs to abort. This is best-effort: if the interrupt fails the batch
   still stops, just after the current item finishes on its own.

The currently-running item is recorded as `canceled`; any not-yet-started items
become `canceled` too (`finalizeCanceledBatch`), and the batch reads as `done`
so polling stops and the panel is dismissible. An actively-looping batch settles
itself in its own `finally`; a paused/idle one is settled inline by the handler.
The snapshot exposes `canceled` and a transient `stopping` (cancel requested,
not yet settled — the panel shows "Stopping...").

Already-completed items are **not** rolled back — a `sorry`-stub or verified
proof produced before Stop was pressed is kept. Stop halts further work; it does
not undo finished work.

## Eligibility

| Button        | Eligible items                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stub all      | un-stubbed **theorems** (`missing-stub`, not a `def`, not in progress)          |
| Formalize all | anything **not yet verified**: `missing-stub`, `stub-generated`, `stale`, `invalid`, `unknown`, `error` (theorems and definitions); never a valid/defined/disproved proof or an in-progress run |

## Tests

- `tests/leanPaneBatch.test.mjs` — request-validation guards (empty/missing
  items, missing project id, malformed label, definition rejected from stub),
  `orderTargetsByUses` dependency ordering, and cancel behavior (unknown batch
  404; an idle/paused batch settles to `canceled`/`done`; a running batch reports
  `stopping` and defers settlement to its loop).
- `tests/leanPaneView.test.mjs` — `stubbableItems` / `formalizableItems`
  selection and operation-aware `formatRepairOutcome`.
- The shared batch loop (snapshot, pause, continue) is covered by
  `tests/leanPaneRepair.test.mjs`; the per-item run pipeline by
  `tests/companion.test.mjs`.
